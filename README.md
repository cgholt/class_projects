# class_projects
Solo assignments and projects from my M.S. computer science program. 

The goal is to show that I have experience in python as well as a well-rounded background 
in data visualization and big data analytics

I have simply uploaded the jupyter notebooks we used in class to complete the data visualization and big data assignments. 

The notebooks include directions and some code from the professor, but the majority of the work was completed by me.
